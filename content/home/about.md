# Biography

I am a master's student at Utah State University. My main research interest is the evolutionary, physiological, and geneic basis of the hornwort pyrenoid.  I am also developing software to make the annotation of RNA editing easier in the organellar genomes of hornworts, liverworts, and ferns. In addition to these projects, I am currently contributing to projects invesitgating the organellar genomes of Santalales, the nuclear and organellar genomes of hornworts, and the role of red and blue light in patchy stomatal conductance.
